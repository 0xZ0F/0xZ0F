## Hell friend, I'm Z0F.
#### What I Do
Reverse engineer software, process exploitation, security research, and I teach reverse engineering in my free time!
Skills:
* C/C++
* C#
* Python
* Bash
* Powershell
* Windows Internals
* Reverse Engineering (specifically Windows).
* Offensive Security (penetration testing, red teaming, etc.)

I currently focus my efforts on two things. Both of which I hope will come to the same result.
* First, I'm a software bug hunter and exploit developer. 
* Second, I (am starting to) teach what I do. I believe that software security has a significant lack of talent and numbers. 

#### State of Cybersecurity, Why I Teach
There are plenty of people working on web security, and far too many working in offensive security roles such as penetration testing. What we don't have enough of is people who find vulnerabilities in the hardware, firmware, software, and infrastructure which runs the world. What I believe to be the reasoning for this is the difficulty in finding those vulnerabilities. Back in the day all you had to do was find an input field that was vulnerable to a buffer overflow by fuzzing it, but it's nowhere near that simple anymore and people are leaving because of it. The reason why it's difficult is because of the lack of education in this field. On top of that, there are many great minds out there with no audience.

I can firmly state that in 5-10 years from now, every beginner to intermediate hacker will know what we consider to be advanced now. Why? Not because it will get easier, and not because we will get smarter. Rather, that's how long it will take for someone with a sizeable audience to finally teach it. Unfortunately, by the time it reaches the greater audience, it will be too late, as the tip of the spear will have moved again.

I hope that I can bring education and research which will help the industry. At the same time, I ask the community to do the same. Create content, create guides, create anything. Together I hope we can protect what we have made.
